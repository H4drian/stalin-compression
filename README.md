# Stalin Compression

Stalin Compression is a data compression algorithm designed
to be highly efficient in both speed and size. The algorithm
is able to take any data and compress it to less than 1kb of
data. Along with this the algorithm's time to compress does 
not change depending on the size of the input along
with the amount of used memory (*O(1)*). This makes Stalin 
compression one of the greatest compression algorithms to
date.
